# pic16f84a-2digit-7segment-counter
2-digit 7-segment display counter (0-99) using PIC16F84A

his project demonstrates a 2-digit (00–99) counter implemented using a PIC16F84A microcontroller and multiplexed 7-segment displays.
The system increments the units digit every second and the tens digit every 10 seconds, using software-based multiplexing to display both digits simultaneously.


Features:

1)Counts from 00 to 99
2)Software multiplexing technique
3)Units digit updates every 1 second
4)Tens digit updates every 10 seconds
5)Designed and simulated in Proteus
6)Written in C (XC8 compiler)
